            The procedure of producing an appraisal report deals with an inspection which leads to an opinion of value. This opinion or estimate is found by a formal process that commonly utilizes the three main "common approaches to value". The Cost Approach is
            one of the approaches that appraisers use to find value; it involves concluding what the improvements would cost without physical depreciation, plus the land value. Another of the processes is the Sales Comparison Approach - which involves
            discovering a comparable analysis to other similar properties within a close proximity which have recently sold. The Sales Comparison Approach is normally the most accurate and clearest indicator of a liklely sales price for a home. One of
            the least common approaches in appraising residential properties is the Income Approach, which is commonly used to determine the market value of a property based on what an investor would pay based on the capital produced by the property. <br><br></div>

        <div id="Why" class="collapse">
          <div class="col-sm-12">
            There are many reasons to purchase an appraisal with the usual reason being real estate and mortgage transactions. Some other reasons for obtaining an appraisal include:
            <ul>
              <li>To get a loan.</li>
              <li>To lower your property taxes.</li>
              <li>To build a case for a homeowner's equity and remove PMI.</li>
              <li>To fight high property taxes.</li>
              <li>To settle an estate.</li>
              <li>To offer you an edge when purchasing a home.</li>
              <li>To find an honest sales price when putting your home on the market.</li>
              <li>To ensure parties are provided just compensation in eminient domain cases.</li>
              <li>Because a government agency such as the IRS requires it.</li>
              <li>If you are ever involved in a lawsuit.</li><br><br>

        <div id="inspection" class="collapse">
          <div class="col-sm-12">
            The appraiser is not a home inspector and he or she does not do a comprehensive home inspection. An inspection is a third-party evaluation of the accessible structure and systems of a house, from the top to the bottom. The general house inspector's report
            will contain an evaluation of the condition of the house's heating systems, central air conditioning system (temperature permitting), interior plumbing and electrical systems, the roof, attic, and accessible insulation, walls, ceilings, floors,
            windows and doors, the foundation, basement, and visible structure. <br><br>

        <div id="difference" class="collapse">
          <div class="col-sm-12">
            Simply put, it's like comparing sugar and saccharin. What the CMA depends on are superficial trends. The appraisal relies on specific valid comparable sales. Location and building costs are also precedent in an appraisal. A CMA delivers a "ball park figure."
            Being a documented and carefully investigated opinion of value, appraisals are defensible and stand up in legal situations. The credentials of the person behind the report is actually the most significant difference between a CMA and an appraisal.
            Real estate agents, who may not have a complete understanding of valuation methods or the entire market, generate CMA's. A certified, Tennessee licensed professional who made their livelihood on valuing homes in and around Sumner County creates
            the appraisal. Likewise, the agent has a vested interest in the property's selling price whereas the appraiser is bound by a code of ethics to collect only a flat sum for assignments, regardless of their value conclusion. <br><br>

              <li>The intended use of the appraisal.</li>

              <li>Precisely what "value" attribute is being reported and what that value means.</li>

              <li>Characteristics of the property that have a bearing on the value, including: location, physical description, legal attributes, economic factors, the property rights in question, and non-real estate items included in the appraisal, such as
                personal property, items that are more or less permanently installed and even intangible items.</li>
              <li>Any known easements, restrictions, encumbrances, leases, reservations, covenants, contracts, declarations, special assessments, ordinances, and the like.</li>

            In communicating an appraisal report, each appraiser must make sure of the following:
            <ul>
              <li>That the information analysis utilized in the appraisal was appropriate.</li>
              <li>Whether individually or collectively, there were no substantial errors contained in the report, nor any material details left out.</li>
              <li>That appraisal services were rendered in a careful and conscientious fashion.</li>
              <li>That a trustworthy, defensible appraisal report was conferred.</li>
            </ul>
            There are intense education and on the job experience requirements that must be met in order to achieve the designation of "licensed appraiser" in Tennessee. Likewise, appraisers must follow a stringent industry code of ethics and observe national standards
            of practice for real estate appraisal. The guidelines for developing an appraisal and reporting its results are insured by enforcement of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP).
            <br> Licensing and certification is achieved through classroom study, tests and experience working under a supervisor. Once licensed, he or she is required to complete continuing education courses so that the license doesn't expire. To see

            Typically, appraisers are called upon by lenders to estimate the value of a home involved in a loan transaction - to make sure the house is truly adequate collateral for the loan. Appraisers also provide opinions for legal settlements, tax matters and
            investment decisions.<br><br></div>

        <div id="estimate" class="collapse">
          <div class="col-sm-12">
            One of the primary tasks an appraiser performs is to assimilate property data. Data can be described as either Specific or General. Specific data is gathered from the property itself; Location, condition, amenities, size and other specifics are gathered
            by the appraiser while on site.

            <br>General data is gathered from a number of places. Local Multiple Listing Services (MLS) provide data on recently sold homes that might be used as comparables. To verify actual sales prices, we research items in the assessor's office and
            other public documents that are usually online nowadays. Flood zone data is retrieved from FEMA data outlets.

            <br>And last but not least, the appraiser assembles general data from his or her collective knowledge gained from creating appraisals for other properties in the same market.<br><br>

            Any time the value of your home or other real property is being used to make a significant financial decision, an appraisal helps. For those selling a home, you'll want to figure out the price that gets you the most profit but also ensures you don't have
            to wait too long for a buyer to show up; an appraisal can help with that. If you're buying, it makes sure you don't overpay. For those settling an estate or divorce, an appraisal from Andrews & Associates Appraisals is the best way to ensure
            assets are divided evenly. A house is often the single, largest financial asset anybody owns. Knowing its true value means you can make the right financial decisions. <br><br></div>

            PMI stands for Private Mortgage Insurance. It guards the lender in case a borrower is unable to pay on the loan and the market price of the house is lower than the loan balance. Once you can prove the amount you owe on your home is less than 80% of the
            home's market value, you can make a case to your lender to drop the PMI.<br><br></div>

            The first step in most appraisals is the home inspection. What this entails is the appraiser, after setting up an appointment, personally going through the home - recording the layout of the rooms, taking photos and documenting the general status of its
            features. Inside, pick up any clutter and make sure we can access things like furnaces and water heaters. In the yard, trim any bushes so we can be free to get an accurate measurement of outside walls.

            <br>To help speed things along plus ensure a more accurate report, attempt if possible to have the following items:
            <ul>
              <li>A plot plan or survey of the house and land (if available).</li>
              <li>A list of any personal property that is part of the home and you intend to be sold with the home, such as an oven, or a washer and dryer, if applicable.</li>
              <li>Any inspection reports, or other recent reports for termites, EIFS (synthetic stucco) wall systems, septic systems and wells.</li>
              <li>Locate copies of the current listing agreement, broker's data sheet and, in the event of a pending sale.</li>
              <li>A list of "suggested" improvements when the property is being appraised "as complete".</li>

        <div id="market" class="collapse">
          <div class="col-sm-12">
            In real estate appraising, Market Value is commonly defined as:
            <br>
            <div id="MarketValue"> "The most probable price (in terms of money) which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price
              is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: the buyer and seller are typically motivated; both
              parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their best interests; a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; payment is made in terms of cash in United States dollars or in terms of financial
              arrangements comparable thereto; and the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale."<br><br> </div>

            In most real estate transactions, the appraisal is ordered by the lender. While the buyer pays for the report as part of the closing costs, the lender retains the right to use the report or any information contained within. The buyer is entitled to a
            copy of the report - it's usually bundled with all the other closing documents - but is not allowed to use the report for any other purpose without permission from the lender.

            <br>The exception to this rule is when a home owner hires an appraiser directly. In these cases, the appraiser may stipulate how the appraisal can be used; for PMI removal, or estate planning or tax challenges, for example. If not noted otherwise,
            the home owner can do whatever they want with the appraisal.<br><br></div>
