# StanShelton-WTA
Our client, Stan Shelton, and we, the coders, worked together and decided upon all the content in this website. On quite a few occasions, we met with Mr. Shelton and discussed what he desired on his website. One thing we discussed was to make the color scheme tie in with his logo, which consists of orange, gray, black and white. Therefore, the color pallette for the website all came from the logo of the clientâ€™s company and was already decided before the website was started. The pictures on the website were chosen to depict Mr. Shelton as the owner and show him as a fun and caring person. We used Arial as our primary font with Palatino font for emphasis so that he would have a simple and professional look. Mr. Shelton suggested the format of each page in the website, displaying the text on the left half of each page and images on the right half. On one page, we made an interactive map that highlights his areas of work. We were aiming for a professional look for his website which would also be soft and inviting. This will let customers know that he cares deeply for his clients but yet is professional as well so that they can feel confident that he can get the job done for them.
